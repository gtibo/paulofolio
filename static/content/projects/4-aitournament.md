A short and fun experimentation about machine learning in Unity using ML-Agents toolkit. I trained an AI to manipulate a ragdoll and walk. It then confronts the player through a sword fight and although it isn't a really challenging enemy for now, the project made me want to dig more in the perspective of developping AI for game developpement.
