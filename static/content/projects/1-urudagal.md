Uru Dagal is a VR game prototype I made with Unity and Blender for the Oculus Quest during my first year of Master. It was ordered for an exhibition at the Cité des métiers about "The city of tomorrow" and was also displayed at the Geneva's Design Days 2021. The game consists of a short journey through a vast abandonned city, mostly inspired by the visuals of Tsutomu Nihei's comics BLAME! and Piranesi's Prisons. As you solve puzzles to progress and explore, you discover the city's past and contemplate its architecture.
