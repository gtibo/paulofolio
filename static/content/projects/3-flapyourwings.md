This mini-game is the outcome of a workshop around p5.js and its libraries. You play as an eagle flying through a forest and must use body movement to avoid trees along the way to survive. Although the game doesn't have an ending, it was an interesting concept and prototype to work with and explore ml5.js for machine learning and p5.play for simple Javascript game engine.
