This group project is the result of a one week long workshop around Arduino's and Sparkfun's microcontrollers. The idea was to create a collaborative and interactive virtual ecosystem animated using body sensors connected altogether by Wi-Fi. It used ESP-32 microcontrollers, Godot game engine and server capabilities and WebSocket to communicate in between.
