Junior game designer graduated in media/game design studies. During my journey, I had a lot of opportunities to take part in the conception and development of many games and interactive narrations as a student, freelance and jammer. In my free time, I also like to explore new possibilities through virtual reality, microcontrollers or machine learning.
Mostly inspired by science-fiction and horror genres in literature and cinema, I enjoy writing speculative stories and extended universes. In the game design field, I am passionate about the survival genre as a narrative-oriented experience, mixing engaging mechanics and immersive visuals.
