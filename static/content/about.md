Aspiring game designer and currently second year student in Media Design Master at [HEAD Geneva](https://www.hesge.ch/head/), I have developped and participated in many projects as a student, freelance and jammer. I am mostly passionate about creating engaging mechanics and immersive narrative experiences. I keep exploring multiple possibilities through virtual reality, microcontrollers or machine learning.
